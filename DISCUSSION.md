# Discussion File for Solace Engineering Assignment

## Initial Thoughts

## Set Up

1. download and unpack the .zip into new github repo, salenas.
2. create project .gitignore
3. install and build
4. had to install docker
5. create .env file with db url

## Installs

1. Required Tools

   - Node.js (version 18 or higher)
   - npm or yarn (package managers)
   - Git (version control)
   - Docker Desktop (for database container)

2. Docker Installation (macOS)

   ```bash
   # Install via Homebrew
   brew install --cask docker
   ```

   After installation:

   1. Launch Docker Desktop from Applications
   2. Wait for Docker to start (Docker icon appears in menu bar)
   3. Verify Docker is working:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker-compose --version
   ```
